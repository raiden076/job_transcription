Hi, welcome to Wendy's. Would you like to try a new Belgian Baconator today?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, can I have a frosty please?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You want the chocolate or the caramel apple?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, vanilla.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't have vanilla. You want to try the new one, caramel apple?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Caramel apple? Interesting. Okay, let me try that.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You want small, medium or large?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, isn't it a dollar for the frosty?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, the promotion is over now.
