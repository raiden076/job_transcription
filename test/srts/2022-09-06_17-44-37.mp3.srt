Hi, welcome to Wendy's. Would you like to try a new blizzard bacon eater today?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, that's okay.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
May I take you out of the place?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, can I get a 10 piece nugget meal?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Plum sauce is fine for the dipping?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Uh, barbecue sauce please.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And cooked to drink?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are you drinking?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The strawberry lemonade light ice please.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Would that be a medium or large combo?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Just regular please.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Anything else for you?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yep, can I also get a number one with no onions?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Cooked to drink?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Cooked to drink, no ice please.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can I make the fries a poutine?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, you can.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Anything else for you?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm also going to get a bacon and cheese baked potato.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And just the burger of the Dave's Burger, the Dave's single, sorry.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And that one's only lettuce, tomato and cheese.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just the sandwich, right?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, just the sandwich.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So it's pretty much, I'm sorry I'm going to make it simple, it's pretty much no onions and no sauce.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sorry.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So it's the sandwich you want only tomato and lettuce, right?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Pickles and cheese.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's what I said, I was trying to fix it, sorry.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pickles and cheese. Anything else for you?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Nope, I believe that's everything.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you.
