Hi, welcome to Wendy's. Would you like to try a new Blazon Baconator today?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No. Do you have those potatoes you get for breakfast?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Potato veggies? No, it's for the breakfast.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's only breakfast, right? Yeah.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can I get three chicken strips?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You want to make it combo?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sure. No, just fries, no drink.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Actually, I'll get a combo. I'll get a combo with the lemonade.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Would that be medium or large combo? Small.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And plum sauce is fine? What other sauces do you have?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Barbecue, plum sauce, honey mustard ranch and the goose pepper ranch.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Barbecue. And you want the original lemonade?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes. Anything else for you?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Drive up please, thank you.
