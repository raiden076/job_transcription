Hi, welcome to Wendy's. Would you like to try a new Blizzard Baconator today?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No, I'm okay. She's here. What do you want? Chicken strips?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hi, can I get the...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Do you have like a five piece strip combo?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We do have three pieces. I can give you on the side, like two strips on the side.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then how much for the crispy for the combo?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Just let me try.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, it's 16.15.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I'll take the chicken strips combo.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do you want to go with them?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you have chicken strips? Oh, you have nuggets?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so I'll take the three piece combo and then the nugget.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The four piece nugget combo.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, for the nuggets we do have five piece and ten nuggets. I can make it combo.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, I'll take the kids meal, the four piece nugget.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
