1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Yeah.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,800
Anything else for you?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,100
Um...

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,700
Is it cooked or drink?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,200
No, can I get a fresh cup?

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,400
Oh, um, instead of the fries, give me the baked potato

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,800
with, um, cheese and bacon.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
And cooked or drink is fine?

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Um, fresh stuff.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
Anything else for you?

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
No, that's it.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Would it be medium or large combo?

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Um, medium.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Anything else for you?

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Nope, that's it.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Drive us, please. Thank you.
